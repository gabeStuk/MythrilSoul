A mod that expands on Steel Soul for some extra difficulty. Fundamentally, this is permadeath in Godhome

## Features
- If the player's health reaches zero, the player is "defeated" regardless of whether they are in a dream.
	- This means death in Godhome and dream bosses (Lost Kin, etc.) is permanent
- Pausing at <\= 2 heath is disabled (prevent save+quit at low health).
	- This feature may not work properly if you are using other mods that affect the pause sequence, such as BenchWarp (menu appears on pause)
	- This can be turned off in settings
 
 Also this probably breaks if you don't have steel soul unlocked, so wait until you beat steel soul to try this challenge.
