A mod that expands on Steel Soul for some extra difficulty. Fundamentally, this is permadeath in Godhome

## Features
- If the player's health reaches zero at ANY point, the player is "defeated" regardless of whether they are in a dream.
	- This means death in Godhome and dream bosses (Lost Kin, etc.) is permanent
- Pausing at <\= 2 heath is disabled (prevent save + quit at low health).
	- Pause disabling can be turned off in settings under "Pause Control"
- The mod also currently features three different themes/appearances for the mod (imagine all the blue stuff as different colors) that definitely aren't just tinted versions of all the steel soul sprites. They can be selected between under "appearance" in settings
 
 Also this probably breaks if you don't have steel soul unlocked, so wait until you beat steel soul to try this challenge.
